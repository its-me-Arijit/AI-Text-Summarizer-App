The AI Text Summarizer App is a web-based application that leverages Artificial Intelligence to generate concise summaries of lengthy texts. Built using **Node.js**, **Replit**, and the **Hugging Face Inference API**, this project allows users to input large text blocks and receive shorter summaries instantly. The integration of **Postman** was used for API exploration and code generation. The app offers a user-friendly interface with text areas for input and output, and an optimized design with responsive elements for a smooth experience across devices. This project demonstrates full-stack development and API integration.
